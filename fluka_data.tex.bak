	\begin{description}[style=nextline]
		\item[SEU Cross-section ($\sigma_{seu}$)] The probability of causing a single event up-set in a memory, typically measured in units of $cm^{2} bit^{-1}$
		\item[LET] The linear energy transfer of a particle in a material, measured in $MeV cm^{-2} mg^{-1}$
		\item[Critical-charge (Q$_{c}$)] The charge required to cause an SEU (or SEE), measured in $\mu C$
		\item[Dose (D)] Energy deposited in a material due to radiation, measured in $\frac{J}{kg}$ in units Grays (Gy)
		\item[HEH Fluence ($\Phi_{HE}$)] The flux of high-energy hadron (hadrons over 20 MeV), per unit area and integrated over time, typically given in $cm^{-2}$
		\item[1 MeV Equivalent Neutron Fluence (in Silicon) ($\Phi_{1 MeV n}$)] The equivalent fluence of 1 MeV neutrons that has the same damage effect (in Silicon), measured in $cm^{-2}$
		\item[Particle Fluence (Lethargy) ($\frac{d \Phi (E) \times E}{dE}$)] The is used in plots of particle fluence, where the fluence value has beem multiplied by the energy binning width (often used in FLUKA), given in $cm^{-2} GeV^{-1}$
