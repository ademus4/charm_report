  Abstract                 = {At the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), installed electronics will be exposed to a radiation field of mixed particles over a wide range of energies. While Monte Carlo transport codes can be used for calculations and predictions of radiation levels, the complex operation and layout of the LHC accelerator give rise to unavoidable uncertainties. Dedicated radiation monitors are therefore installed in locations of the electronics to provide an online measurement of the radiation levels pertinent to single-event upsets (SEUs). This paper addresses the method that has been applied to calibrate these radiation monitors for their use in mixed radiation fields. New irradiation tests to determine the sensitivity to neutrons from a few megaelectronvolts to 20 MeV will be presented along with additional irradiation tests with high-energy protons .},

  Abstract                 = {The effect of fast neutron irradiation on the properties of wide-base p-i-n diodes has been investigated both theoretically and experimentally. Dependence of the base voltage on irradiation dose was studied for diodes at intermediate level injection. The change in resistivity of silicon under neutron irradiation should be taken into account as well as change in the carrier lifetime. The main contribution to the I-V curve shift of the wide-base p-i-n diode arises from the resistivity change for doses larger than 20-30 Gy. Such diodes have a high radiation sensitivity (above 5 V.Gy-1 for diodes with base width of 0.5 cm made of silicon with resistivity of 5x104 O.cm). Using p-i-n diodes at intermediate level injection one can significantly widen the measurement range of fast neutron doses.},
